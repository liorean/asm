## Learning assembly

I've dabbled in plenty of programming languages, though seldom stayed a long time with any given one. One of the things I've never really done is get down to the roots, strip away as much as is feasible and getting down close to the machine itself. One of the things I've been considering is code generation and runtime code modification. In trying to get the understanding necessary to do a project like that, I've been learning some assembly programming.

This project is my documentation of my venture into that space, and so far it consists of a really small set of small programs that I've been making. Programs get added when I feel like they are reasonably well polished and can provide a good explanation of what it adds on top of earlier programs.
